this is the "Brian Kernighans Algorithm"
to get the cout of the setBit in a number

here we perform the (&) operation between the number and the 
number-1 


number   = 7 => 111
number-1 = 6 => 110

number   = 5 => 101
number-1 = 4 => 100

number   = 12 => 1100
number-1 = 11 => 1011

number & (number-1)

bit  bit-1   bit=bit&(bit-1)  count
12    11      8                0
                               1
8     7       0               
                               2

here we calculate the setBit of the number to perform the & 
between number and number-1

 -> number-1 always has one unset bit compare to the number

 -> so here we perform & operation and intialize the result again in number and increase the count
