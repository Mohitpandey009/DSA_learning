In this code I am checking the number pairty bit are diffreant 
or not 
 look here 
 num = 10  => 1010  (the pairty bit here diffrent )
 num = 8   => 1000  (here the only last bit is diffrent all other same so its not pairty bit)

 operation ->

 pair = num>>1

 we righ shift the num so we get the exact diffrent bit of the num 

 num^pair

 now we perform the xor in between the if they are exactly same the result all bit are 1 (set)
